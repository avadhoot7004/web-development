## Day 0 
**01-01-2025**
- Introduction of training programme and general discussion.

## Day 1
**02-01-2025**
- On **Day 1** of the training, the focus was on understanding basic HTML elements and creating a simple web page.

This task provided practice in using HTML forms, input fields, and links for basic navigation between pages.

## Day 2
**03-01-2025**
- On **Day 2** of the training, the focus was on understanding different types of HTML tags for listing and table elements. 
- The session covered tags like `<li>`, `<dt>`, `<th>`, and `<tr>`, which are used for creating lists and tables.

### Listing Techniques:
- **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)** and **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)** were introduced, and how to use the `<li>` tag to list items.
- **Definition Lists (`<dl>`)** were explained, with the use of the `<dt>` and `<dd>` tags for definitions.

### Task: Create Tables and Lists

The task for the day involved:
- Creating **tables** using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags.
- Creating **lists** using `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags for better organization of content.
- - Navigate to the task [here](listsTables/index.html).

### Git and GitHub Introduction:
- **Git** and **GitHub** were introduced as tools for version control.
- We were encouraged to use **Git** for tracking changes to our projects and to upload our tasks to **GitHub** for collaboration and sharing.

This task provided hands-on experience with structuring content using lists and tables, and it laid the foundation for version control using **Git** and **GitHub**.

## Day 3
**06-01-2025**
- On **Day 3** of the training, the focus was on understanding the basics of **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) and how to apply styles to HTML elements.
- The session covered inline styling, linking an external `styles.css` file, and applying various CSS properties such as fonts, font colors, background colors, centering, and basic CSS selectors like `class` and `id`.

### CSS Basics:
- **Inline CSS**: We learned how to apply styles directly within HTML tags using the `style` attribute.
- **Linking External CSS**: The method of linking an external CSS file using the `<link>` tag was explained.
- **Font and Background Styling**: We explored how to modify font styles, font colors, and background colors for various elements.
- **Centering Content**: Methods for centering text and block-level elements (using `text-align` and `margin: auto`) were demonstrated.
- **Marquee**: The `<marquee>` tag was introduced for creating scrolling text.

### Task: Add Styling to Signup/Login Page
The main task for the day was to apply **CSS styling** to the **signup/login page** created on Day 1. This included:
- Styling the **form** and **input fields**.
- Adding background colors and text colors.
- Styling the **submit button** and **form layout** to make the page visually appealing.

### CSS Selectors:
- We practiced using **class selectors** (e.g., `.classdata`) and **ID selectors** (e.g., `#loginForm`) to apply styles to specific elements on the page.

This task provided hands-on experience in using **CSS** to style web pages, which is essential for creating user-friendly and visually attractive websites.

## Day 4
**07-01-2025**
- On **Day 4** of the training, we continued exploring **CSS** with a focus on advanced layout techniques such as **Flexbox** and **Grid Layout**. 
- We also began our journey with **JavaScript (JS)**, covering its basics, syntax, and interaction with HTML.

### Advanced CSS Layouts:
- **Flexbox**: We explored the **flexbox model**, a one-dimensional layout system for distributing space and aligning items in a container.
  - We learned how to use the `display: flex;` property and various flexbox properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction`.

- **Grid Layout**: We then moved on to **CSS Grid Layout**, a two-dimensional system for creating complex web layouts. 
  - We understood the use of `display: grid;` and other properties like `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-gap`.

- **Box Model**: We learned about the **CSS Box Model**, which includes the content, padding, border, and margin areas around an element. Understanding this model is crucial for layout design.
  
- **.container Class**: We discussed the importance of using the `.container` class to wrap content in both flexbox and grid layouts, helping to center or limit content width.

### JavaScript Basics:
- **Basic JS**: We were introduced to Javascript and its basics, how it works and its core functionality. We were also introduced to **DOM** and **BOM** models.

- **Client-Side JavaScript**: We discussed how JavaScript is primarily used as a **client-side scripting language** to create interactive web pages, as opposed to server-side languages.

- **JS Limitations**: We covered some limitations of JavaScript, including its inability to manipulate files directly on the server and its single-threaded nature.

- **JS Syntax**: We learned about **JavaScript syntax**, including rules for writing variables, functions, and expressions.

### Writing First JavaScript Code:
- **Alert Function**: Our first JavaScript code involved using the `alert()` function to display a simple message to the user.

### Task: Hands-on practice with **Flexbox** and **Grid** layouts and revision of JavaScript basics.
- This included revising basics of JS and trying out the newly learnt CSS concepts.
